1️⃣ Problem Statement

Brain tumors are life-threatening and require early and accurate detection for effective treatment.
Analyzing MRI scans manually is:

⚠️ Time-consuming
<br><br/>
⚠️ Requires expert radiologists
<br><br/>
⚠️ Prone to human error
<br><br/>
This project solves that by developing an AI-powered tumor detection system using YOLOv12, enabling fast, reliable detection of tumor regions from MRI images.
The goal is to build a simple, accessible, and high-accuracy tool for educational and research use.


2️⃣ Scope of the Project

This project covers:

🎯 Training YOLOv12 on MRI brain scan datasets
<br><br/>
🎯 Detecting tumor regions using bounding boxes
<br><br/>
🎯 Providing a ready-to-use weight file (best.pt)
<br><br/>
🎯 A clean inference notebook for easy testing
<br><br/>
🎯 Sample images for quick demo
<br><br/>
🎯 Modular code that can be extended to Multi-class tumor detection
